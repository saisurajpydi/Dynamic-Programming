0-1 Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

eg:

wt[] =  [1 , 3 , 4 , 5]
val[] = [1 , 4 , 5 , 7]
W = 7
"""
wt =  [10,20,30]            #[1,3,4,5]
val = [60,100,120] #[1,4,5,7]
n = len(wt)
W = 50
row = n + 1
col = W + 1
t = [[-1] * col] * row
def knapsack(wt,val,W,n):
    if( n == 0 or W == 0):
        return 0
    if( t[n][W] != -1):
        return t[n][W]
    if( wt[n-1] <= W):
        t[n][W] = max(val[n-1] + knapsack(wt,val,W-wt[n-1],n-1),knapsack(wt,val,W,n-1))
    if( wt[n-1] > W):
        t[n][W] = knapsack(wt,val,W,n-1)
    return t[n][W]
       

print(knapsack(wt,val,W,n))
